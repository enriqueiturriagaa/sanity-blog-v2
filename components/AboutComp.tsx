      <p className='mb-4'>
        "Nullius in verba" is a Latin phrase meaning "On the word of no one." It represents the idea that knowledge should be based on evidence, rather than authority or tradition. This motto is a reminder that understanding should always be open to questioning and that new discoveries can fundamentally change what we know about the world.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-4'>If you want to be happy and successful, you are looking for a non-common outcome, and you're never going to get any non-common outcome by doing and reading the things common people do and read.</p>
      <p className='my-5 text-xl font-bold font-gochi'>It takes a level of contrarianism to do or become uncommon</p>
      <p className='mb-4'>Let the evidence speak for itself. Keep an open mind, question everything and be ready for new discoveries that will change our understanding of the world.</p>

      <p className='mb-4'>This is my online space for... pretty much anything. There's no agenda behind this site other than writing/Uploading whatever I want.</p>
      <p className='mb-4'>That's why I named this site "Nullius in verba", because you shouldn't take my word (or anyone's word) for anything. Life is <span className='line-through'>fucking</span> amazing if you are willing to experience it yourself. Find your own way.</p>
